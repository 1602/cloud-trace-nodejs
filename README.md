## Overview

*This module is experimental, and should be used by early adopters. This module uses APIs there may be undocumented and may be subject to change without notice.*

[Cloud Trace](https://cloud.google.com/cloud-trace/) is a feature of [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/) that collects latency data from your applications and displays it in near real-time in the [Google Developers Console](https://console.developers.google.com/?_ga=1.258049870.576536942.1443543237). This module provides Cloud Trace support for Node.js applications.

## Prerequisites
1. You are using / deploying-with Node.js version 0.12 or greater.
1. You need to have created a project on GCP. You don't necessarily have to deploy your app to GCP, but traces must be attributed to a project to be viewed.
1. [Enable the Trace API](https://console.developers.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=cloudtrace) for your project.
1. (Only if you are deploying to Google Compute Engine) Your VM instances need to be created with the 'Allow API access' checkbox selected (see screenshot). If you already have VMs that were created without API access, you will additionally need to follow the instructions in the *Running elsewhere* section.

## Running on Google Cloud Platform
1. Install the module, and save it as a dependency in your `package.json`:

   `npm install --save @google/cloud-trace`
1. Ensure that the trace agent gets loaded **as the first thing** during your application's startup. You can add the following line as to load the trace agent module in your startup script. For example, if your startup script is `server.js`, add the following as the *very first line* to `server.js`:

   ``` javascript
   // Activate Google cloud trace agent (*must be first line of the app*)
   require('@google/cloud-trace').start();
   ```

Deploy your application to Google Cloud and start sending some requests towards your application. In about 30 seconds or so, you should see trace data gathered in the Monitoring -> Traces view in your Google Cloud console:

![Trace List](doc/images/tracelist.png?raw=true)

This is the trace list that shows a sampling of the incoming requests your application is receiving. You can click on a URI to drill down into the details. This will show you the RPCs made by your application and their associated latency:

![Trace View](doc/images/traceview.png?raw=true)

Note: When you open on up the traces view under the monitoring header, you may see a warning saying traces are disabled (shown below). This refers to traces gathered by the app server responsible for hosting your application. These traces are gathered independently of the traces generated by our agent and carry less semantic information about the behavior of your application. We recommend you DO NOT click Enable trace at this time.

## Running elsewhere

If you want to run your application somewhere other than Google Cloud Platform, or if you GCE VMs were created without API access, you will need to take two additional steps:

1. Provide your project-number at the time you start the trace agent. Your project number can be found in the developer console by clicking gear in the upper left hand corner and looking at Project information:

   ```javascript
   // Activate Google cloud trace agent (*must be first line of the app*)
   require('@google/cloud-trace').start({projectId: 'your-project-number-here'});
   ```
1. Provide credentials to authenticate with the Trace API.
  * Provide credentials via the environment variable GOOGLE\_APPLICATION\_CREDENTIALS. The simplest way to get a credential for this purpose is to create a service account using the Google Developers Console in the section APIs & Auth, in the sub-section Credentials. Create a service account (Create New ClientID under the OAuth heading) or choose an existing one and select Generate new JSON key. Set the environment variable GOOGLE\_APPLICATION\_CREDENTIALS to the path of the JSON file downloaded.

## Details

The trace agent can do automatic tracing of the following http frameworks:
* express v4+
* restify v3+ (experimental)
* hapi v8 (experimental)

We will do automatic tracing of the following kinds of RPCs performed by your application:
* Outbound HTTP requests
* MongoDB v2+
* Redis v0.12+ (experimental)

We are working on expanding the types of frameworks and services we can do automatic tracing for. We are also interested in hearing your feedback on what other frameworks, or versions, you would like to see supported. This would help us prioritize support going forward.

We also have an API that lets you add custom spans to the traces automatically. This can be useful if your application does sizable synchronous or asynchronous work that is not using an existing IO or RPC module.

### (Optional) Trace Configuration

The trace agent can be configured by passing a configurations object to the agent `start` method. This configuration option accepts all values in the [default configuration](config.js).

One configuration option of note is `enhancedDatabaseReporting`. Setting this option to `true` will cause database operations for redis and MongoDB to record query summaries and results as labels on reported trace spans.

### (Optional) Custom Tracing API

Our goal is for the trace agent to automatically trace all the popular Node.js web frameworks, as well as RPC and persistence layers. However, you may still want to create custom spans to add additional details if your application does sizable on- or off-CPU work inside a request. We do provide an API to enable that.

We only support custom spans inside existing top-level request-handling framework (e.g. express, hapi, etc.).

The API for creating custom spans and modifying transaction metadata is exposed through the agent returned by requiring the module:

```javascript
  var agent = require('@google/cloud-trace').start();
```

Starting a new custom span. This command optionally takes an object of key value pairs which specify labels to be attached to the span:

```javascript
  var opaque = agent.startSpan('name', {key: 'my value'});
```

Ending a custom span. This command optionally takes an object of key value pairs which specify labels to be attached to the span:

```javascript
  agent.endSpan(opaque, {key: 'my value'});
```

Alternatively, we also support a mocha-style interface that might be a bit more convenient to use. The runInSpan method takes a function to execute inside a custom span with the provided name. The function may be synchronous or asynchronous. If it is asynchronous, it must accept a 'endSpan' function as an argument that should be called once the asynchronous work has completed.

```javascript
  agent.runInSpan('name', {key: 'my value'}, function() {
    doSynchronousWork();
  });

  agent.runInSpan('name', {key: 'my value'}, function(endSpan) {
    doAsyncWork(function(result) {
      processResult(result);
      endSpan({key2: 'my value2'});
    });
  });
```

It is possible to rename the current top-level request transaction, to give it a more meaningful name. By default we use the name of the express (or hapi/restify) route as the transaction name:

```javascript
  agent.setTransactionName('new name');
```

Adding a label to the current top-level request transaction:

```javascript
  agent.addTransactionLabel('label-key', 'label-value');
```
